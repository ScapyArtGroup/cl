# GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line, and it's now available in beta. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to
the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

## Availability

While in beta, GitHub CLI is available for repos hosted on GitHub.com only. It currently does not support repositories hosted on GitHub Enterprise Server or other hosting providers. We are planning on adding support for GitHub Enterprise Server after GitHub CLI is out of beta (likely towards the end of 2020), and we want to ensure that the API endpoints we use are more widely available for GHES versions that most GitHub customers are on.

## We want your feedback

We'd love to hear your feedback about `gh`. If you spot bugs or have features that you'd really like to see in `gh`, please check out the [contributing page][].

## Usage

- `gh pr [status, list, view, checkout, create]`
- `gh issue [status, list, view, create]`
- `gh repo [view, create, clone, fork]`
- `gh config [get, set]`
- `gh help`

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.
